Person 1: Behavior Analysis & Documentation
Tasks:

Step 1: Fully-Dressed Use Case

Take one of your main use cases (e.g., "View Real-Time Data" or "Record Weather Data")
Expand it with full details including:

Preconditions
Postconditions
Main Success Scenario (step-by-step)
Alternative flows
Exception flows




Step 3: High-level Activity Diagram

Create activity diagram showing the flow of the system
Include decision points, parallel activities
Show user actions and system responses


Step 4: High-level State Diagram

Model the states of the weather station system
States could be: Idle, DisplayingRealTime, DisplayingHourly, DisplayingDaily, RecordingData, TransmittingData
Show transitions between states


Document Formatting

Add Cover Sheet
Create Table of Contents
Create Table of Figures
Compile all sections into final document
Add page numbers and formatting




Person 2: Design Phase & Interaction Analysis
Tasks:

Step 2: High-level Sequence Diagram

Create sequence diagram for main use case
Show interactions between: User, Button, MicroController, Sensor, Display, MemoryBank, SatelliteLink
Keep it high-level (analysis phase)


Step 5: Detailed Sequence Diagrams (3-4 diagrams)

Sequence 1: User views real-time data
Sequence 2: System records periodic data
Sequence 3: User views historical data (hourly/daily)
Sequence 4 (optional): System transmits data via satellite
Include actual method calls like readSensor(), displayReading(), storeData()


Step 6: Refined Class Diagram

Take the conceptual model from Lab 2
Add methods/operations to each class (e.g., MicroController.readSensor(), Display.showReading())
Add attributes (e.g., TemperatureReading.value, TemperatureReading.timestamp)
Refine associations with proper navigation arrows
Add visibility (+public, -private, #protected)


Implementation Recommendations & Notes

Based on your design, suggest implementation approach
Recommend design patterns (Strategy pattern for sensors)
Note any technical considerations
